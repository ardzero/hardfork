# Publishing your package to npm

> **Scaffold:** Command examples were rewritten from the bunpack template to **hardfork** (your `package.json` `name`). If the name you publish to npm will differ, search the repo and align this guide, `publish-workflow-gen.ts`, and npm Trusted Publisher before releasing.

This package is published as `hardfork`.

> Change the package name with your own package name.
> Note: when a package is published with `create-` prefix user can use it like `bun create [suffix]`

> #### ⚠️ Important: The guide below applyies to any cli/package bootstraped using [bunpack](https://github.com/ardzero/bunpack), if you're trying use this as reference for other projects templates, some changes are required

# Publishing Locally (recommended for first deployment)

## 1. Prerequisites

- **npm account**: [https://www.npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)
- **Bun** (for the build script): [https://bun.sh](https://bun.sh) — install and ensure `bun` is on your `PATH`
- **npm CLI** (ships with Node.js): used for `npm login`, `npm publish`, `npm pack`

Check:

```bash
node -v #should look like v2x.x.x
npm -v #should look like 1x.x.x
bun -v #should look like 1.x.x
```

---

## 2. Log in to npm

```bash
npm login
```

Follow the prompts (username, password, email, and OTP if 2FA is enabled). Confirm:

```bash
npm whoami
```

---

## 3. Check that the package name is free

The published name is the `"name"` field in `package.json` (`hardfork`). See if it is already taken:

```bash
npm view hardfork 2>&1
```

- If it prints metadata, the name is taken — change `"name"` in `package.json` (and update this guide / README references), or use a [scoped name](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scope) like `@yourscope/hardfork`.

---

## 4. Build and inspect the tarball (recommended)

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

`npm pack --dry-run` lists exactly what would be published (controlled by the `"files"` field: `dist`, `README.md`, plus always-included `package.json`).

To create a local `.tgz` for manual inspection:

```bash
npm pack
```

---

## 5. Version bump

Do not reuse a published version. Bump before each release:

```bash
# patch: 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2
npm version patch

# minor: 0.0.2 -> 0.1.0
npm version minor

# major: 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
npm version major
```

That updates `package.json`, creates a git commit, and a tag (if the repo is a git worktree with a clean state). To bump **without** git commit/tag:

```bash
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
```

Then commit and tag yourself if you want that in history.

---

## 6. Publish

From the repo root (with a clean `dist/` or rely on `prepublishOnly`):

```bash
npm publish
```

### 2FA (OTP)

If your npm account uses 2FA for **writes**:

```bash
npm publish --otp=123456
```

Replace `123456` with the current code from your authenticator app.

### Scoped packages (`@scope/name`)

If you ever rename to a scope, the first publish is usually:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Unscoped packages like `hardfork` do **not** need `--access public`.

---

## 7. Verify after publish

Wait a few seconds, then:

```bash
npm view hardfork version
npx hardfork@latest --help
```

---

## 8. Useful npm commands

| Goal                                                 | Command                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| See what would ship                                  | `npm pack --dry-run`                                               |
| Deprecate a bad version (keeps installs possible)    | `npm deprecate hardfork@0.0.1 "reason"`                      |
| Yank latest tag only (discouraged; prefer deprecate) | Read [unpublish policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish) |

Avoid `npm unpublish` except in narrow cases; npm’s policy restricts removing versions others may depend on.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Issue                                 | What to try                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `E403` / “You do not have permission” | Wrong user (`npm whoami`), or name owned by someone else.                    |
| `E409` / version exists               | Bump `version` in `package.json` (`npm version patch`).                      |
| `prepublishOnly` fails                | Run `bun run build` locally and read the error; fix TypeScript/build issues. |
| `ENOENT` on `dist/cli.js`             | Run `bun run build`; confirm `dist/cli.js` exists before publish.            |
| OTP errors                            | `npm publish --otp=...` with a fresh code.                                   |

---

## Quick checklist

1. `npm whoami` → correct account
2. `npm view hardfork` → name strategy OK
3. `bun run build` → succeeds
4. `npm pack --dry-run` → expected files only
5. `npm version patch` (or manual version bump)
6. `npm publish` (+ `--otp` if required)
7. `npx hardfork@latest --help` → smoke test

# Then setup publishing using github workflow CI/CD

UCI/CD plublishes you package to npm when you push code to github repo's `main` branch, so you don't have to manually go throuhgh all the steps of publishing locally.

### This setup uses **npm Trusted Publisher (OIDC)**, not `NPM_TOKEN`.

> In order to to setup **npm Trusted Publisher (OIDC)** the pkg needs to be published on npm first, so do the first publish locally then follow the guide below to setup the CI/CD

---

## 1) Setup npm Trusted Publisher

![npm trusted publisher config ui screenshot](https://i.ibb.co.com/dsj55GPJ/image.png)

Go to setting tab of your npm package, open **Trusted Publisher** and use:

- **Publisher**: `GitHub Actions`
- **Organization or user**: `yourGithubUserName` (or your actual repo owner if changed)
- **Repository**: `yourRepoName` (or your actual repo name if changed)
- **Workflow filename**: `publish-package.yml` (filename only, not full path — must match `workflowFilename` in `publish-workflow-gen.ts`)
- **Environment name**: `npm` (must match `environment: npm` on the job)

Then click **Set up connection**.

> **Optional:** Create a GitHub **Environment** named `npm` under repo **Settings → Environments** if it does not exist yet (required reviewers / branch rules are optional).

---

## 2) Generating the GitHub workflow YAML

Bunpack provides a helpful utility file `publish-workflow-gen.ts` to auto generate the github workflow.

You can run it by running the command below from package project/folder root:

```bash
bun run gen:publish-workflow
```

> (equivalent to `bun run ./publish-workflow-gen.ts`.)

> **⚠️ important:**  
> You must rerun the workflow generator if you change **any** field in the workflow config in `publish-workflow-gen.ts` or update your `package.json` (such as `name`, `version`, or any other field that might impact the workflow logic).

### Configs you may want to change

Edit only `workflowConfig` in `publish-workflow-gen.ts`:

| Field              | Purpose                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workflowName`     | Workflow title (defaults to `Publish ${package.json name} to npm`)                                                            |
| `watchBranches`    | Branches that trigger on push (e.g. `main`)                                                                                   |
| `watchPaths`       | Path/files that trigger the worflow when changed; the workflow file path is **appended automatically** as the **last** entry  |
| `nodeVersion`      | Passed to `actions/setup-node`                                                                                                |
| `environmentName`  | GitHub job `environment:` and npm Trusted Publisher **Environment name**                                                      |
| `workflowDir`      | Output directory (default `.github/workflows`)                                                                                |
| `workflowFilename` | Output filename (default `publish-package.yml`) — **must match** the workflow filename you configure in npm Trusted Publisher |

---

## 3) First CI publish flow

1. Ensure `package.json` version is new (not published already).
2. Push commit to `main` (or manually trigger `workflow_dispatch` in Actions tab).
3. Workflow checks npm registry and runs `npm publish` only if that version is not already on the registry. Your workflow run should look something like this:
   ![successful workflow run ui screenshot](https://i.ibb.co.com/3ywgch8r/image.png)

### Now Verify with:

```bash
npm view hardfork version
bunx hardfork@latest --help
```

---

## 4) Versioning policy for CI

- CI publish is **version-driven**. If `package.json` version already exists on npm, publish is skipped.
- Always bump version before merge to `main`:

```bash
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
git add package.json bun.lock
git commit -m "release: bump hardfork to x.y.z"
git push
```

---

## 5) Common pitfalls / caveats / warnings (important)

- `id-token: write` is mandatory. Without it, Trusted Publisher auth fails.
- Trusted Publisher metadata must match exactly (owner/repo/workflow filename and environment if used).
- `workflow filename` in npm is only the file name (`publish-package.yml`), not `.github/workflows/publish-package.yml`.
- If repo ownership changes (transfer/fork/rename), you must update Trusted Publisher config in npm.
- Keep `prepublishOnly` intact (`bun run build`), otherwise CI may publish stale or missing `dist/`.
- `npm publish --provenance` needs GitHub-hosted runners + OIDC; avoid replacing with self-hosted until you validate provenance flow.
- Avoid path filters that are too narrow; if `package.json` changes are excluded, release won’t trigger.
- `contents: write` is not needed here (reference used it because a later step `git push`’d wrapper changes). This repo workflow only needs `contents: read` unless you add commit/push steps.
- CI skips already-published versions by design; that is a safety feature, not a failure.

## CI/CD Troubleshooting

| Issue                                          | What to try                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `403 Forbidden` during CI publish              | Check Trusted Publisher mapping in npm package settings (owner/repo/workflow/env must match exactly).                          |
| `No OIDC token` / auth failures                | Ensure workflow `permissions` has `id-token: write`.                                                                           |
| Workflow runs but publish step skipped         | Version already exists on npm (`npm view hardfork@<version> version`). Bump version and rerun.                           |
| Workflow never triggered on push               | Validate `push.branches` and `push.paths` filters include changed files.                                                       |
| `npm ERR! code E404` for package/version check | For unpublished versions this is expected; script handles it and continues.                                                    |
| `bun install` fails in CI                      | Fix lockfile / `package.json` mismatch locally, run `bun install`, commit `bun.lock` if it changed, push.                      |
| Trusted Publisher rejects the run              | GitHub environment name, workflow file name, repo owner/name must match npm Trusted Publisher fields exactly (`npm` env here). |
| Package publishes but command fails right away | Registry propagation delay; retry smoke test after 30-120 seconds.                                                             |

---

## CI/CD Quick checklist

1. `.github/workflows/publish-package.yml` exists and is committed (regenerate with `bun run gen:publish-workflow` after editing `publish-workflow-gen.ts`).
2. npm Trusted Publisher is configured for your GitHub owner / repo / `publish-package.yml` with environment `npm`, and GitHub has an environment named `npm`.
3. Workflow has `permissions.id-token: write`.
4. `package.json` version is bumped to an unpublished version.
5. Commit pushed to `main` (or manual dispatch run triggered).
6. Actions run shows publish step executed (not skipped).
7. `npm view hardfork version` + `npx hardfork@latest --help` pass.
